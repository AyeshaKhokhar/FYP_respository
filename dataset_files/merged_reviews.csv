Pros:
1) Rooms are large, spacious and comfortable. I was very satisfied with the room service and cleanliness.
2) The staff was friendly and solution oriented. On the 10th floor, I would like to thank Ms. Zeynep who hosted us very well.
3) Fitness and sauna facilities were very good.
4) The food in the Chinese Restaurant inside the hotel was quite delicious.
5) The hotel restaurant had an extensive food menu. Don't miss the buffet times.

Cons:
1) Since the room windows are locked, you can ventilate the room with air conditioners. The rooms on the north side were quite humid. Fortunately they changed the room.
2) The location of the hotel can be called the center of the city. Traffic noise can sometimes be annoying.
3) The room cards lose their functionality and you may need to re-identify the card to your room almost every day.

To summarize, I was satisfied with the hotel and the staff and would choose it again on my next visit to Karachi.",Avari Tower Karachi
